There is a class of $a students taking a T/F quiz of 10 questions. We would normally think it unlikely that a student would get more than 2 questions right out of 10 by flipping a coin, but with a class this large, it might be possible. Here we'll calculate the probability of at least one student in the class of size $a getting more than 2 questions right.

* What is the probability of a particular student getting exactly 2 questions right?

[_]

* What is the probability of a particular student getting exactly 1 question right?

[_]

* What is the probability of a particular student getting no questions right?

[_]

* What is the probability of a particular student getting at most 2 questions right?

[_]

* What is the probability of a particular student getting 3 or more questions right?

[_]

* What is the probability of every student in the class getting 3 or more questions right?

[_]

* What is the probability of some student in the class getting at most 2 questions right?
