### Full House: 2 of one rank and 3 of another rank ###
*Remember, the deck you are using has $ns suits and $nr ranks.*

* The number of possibilities for the rank of the triple is

[_]

* Given the rank of the triple, the number of possibilities for the rank of the pair is

[_]

* The number of possibilities for the suit of the triple is

[_]

* The number of possibilities for the suit of the pair is

[_]

* Thus the number of hands that is a full house is

[_]

* The ratio of this number to the number of all hands

[_]
